Eight-Year-Old Paladin

Plastic sword
Cardboard crown
Sticker stars
All falling down
Mom said
“Hero
Lights out”
But the dungeon
In my head
Won’t shut its mouth

They all laugh at the armor I drew
Crayon crest on a torn-up school glue
But in my chest there’s a cracked halo
Rusty gold
Burning slow

I’m an eight-year-old paladin
Too small for the weight I’m in
Holding up the world with scarred little hands
Candy wrappers
Ruins
Lands
If I fall
Does the quest begin again
Or did the story end
With an eight-year-old paladin

Lunchbox shield
Bent in half
Spilled milk
Battle aftermath
Teacher says
“Just play nice”
But I see monsters
In every side-eye
Every roll of the dice

They say “grow up
It’s only pretend”
But I’m tanking every hit they send
Under the desk there’s a tired saint
Armor’s paint
Starting to flake

I’m an eight-year-old paladin
Too small for the weight I’m in
Holding up the world with scarred little hands
Candy wrappers
Ruins
Lands
If I fall
Does the quest begin again
Or did the story end
With an eight-year-old paladin

[double-time drums
Guitars trading manic solos]
Steel-on-steel in the hallway roar
Detuned beasts crawling from the floor
Seven low voices hissing my name
“Drop the shield
Join the shame”

Heartbeat glitches
Gravity bends
Halo tumbles
Signal ends

“Too much”
“Not enough”
“Grow up”
“Stay tough”
Face in the mirror keeps pixelating
Golden boy
Now disintegrating

Teeth of the world in a grinding spin
Wobble and crash as they drag me in
Armor dissolves into coughing smoke
Tiny chest
Crushed on a joke

I’m an eight-year-old paladin
Too small for the weight I’m in
Holding up the world with scarred little hands
Candy wrappers
Ruins
Lands
If I fall
Does the quest begin again
Or did the story end
With an eight-year-old paladin

Keyboards blazing like a cartoon dawn
Choirs of kids screaming “carry on”
I raise my sword made of taped-up dreams
Split the dark
With a plastic beam

Tonight the crowd is the fear I had
All my ghosts in a matching badge
I bow
I shake
But I still stand
Just an eight-year-old paladin
