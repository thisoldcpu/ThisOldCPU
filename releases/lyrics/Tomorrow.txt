Tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Morning comes like a verdict
Same cracked mug
Same chipped plate
Calendar squares all bleeding
Into one long
Grey shape
I wash the night from my face
Watch it spiral down the drain
Practice breathing in the mirror
Like it's something I can tame

[Chorus]
Tomorrow
I don't know you
But I’m walking your way
Tomorrow
You might break me
I’ll be here anyway
Tomorrow
One small step
Same worn shoes
Tomorrow
If I can’t win
I’ll still choose

[Verse 2]
Emails queue like a sentence
Boss talks
I taste metal and dust
Fluorescent hum over tired eyes
Hands on the keys out of trust
You said
"Call if it gets too dark"
Your voice shaking through the phone
I marked the date on my arm
So the ink would say I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Tomorrow
I don't know you
But I’m walking your way
Tomorrow
You might break me
I’ll be here anyway
Tomorrow
One small step
Same worn shoes
Tomorrow
If I can’t win
I’ll still choose

[Bridge]
I fold the fear
In a pocket I can’t reach
Name every scar
Like a child I’ll never teach
If hope is soft
Let it bruise against my chest
If I fall short
Let the failing be my yes

[Chorus]
Tomorrow
I don't know you
But I’m walking your way
Tomorrow
You might break me
I’ll be here anyway
Tomorrow
One small step
Same worn shoes
Tomorrow
If I can’t win
I’ll still choose
