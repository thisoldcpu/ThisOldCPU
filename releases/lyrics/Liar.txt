Liar

[Verse 1]
You said
"I'm fine"
Eyes fixed on the window frame
That tiny twitch
At the corner gave you away
You stacked your words
Like boxes in the hallway
Every fragile truth
Buried under "I'm okay"

[Chorus]
Liar
Every quiet "I'm alright" cuts deeper
Liar
You keep bleeding through your careful fever
I can hear the crack
Breaking in your voice
Say it
Say it
Or it swallows your choice

[Verse 2]
I watched you fold
Your anger into small talk
Turn a breaking wave
Into ripples on the sidewalk
You stitched your past
Into sleeves you never roll
All those hidden scars
Burning holes in every coat

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If I believed you
You would disappear
If I confront you
You might drown right here
So I stand in the doorway
Caught in your storm
Begging you silently
To finally transform

[Chorus]
