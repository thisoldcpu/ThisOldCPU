Blood on the Playa, Buried in the Selva

[Verse 1]
Dust on my tongue
Ash in my hair
You drew a heart in the sand
Then left it there

Rust on the sun
Heart like a flare
You said
“Out here we’re forgiven”
But you never stayed to swear

[Chorus]
Blood on the playa
Buried in the selva
All of your promises
Rot in the roots we fed from
You said we were sacred
Screamed it like a mantra
Now every echo of your name
Is a ghost in the canopy
Canta (hey)

[Verse 2]
Cheap cotton wings
Pinned to your back
You danced in the dust storm
Never looked back

Green in your eyes
Smoke in your laugh
You carved my name in a cactus
Then watched the needles attack

[Chorus]
Blood on the playa
Buried in the selva
All of your promises
Rot in the roots we fed from
You said we were sacred
Screamed it like a mantra
Now every echo of your name
Is a ghost in the canopy
Canta (oh)

[Bridge]
You left your mask in my backpack
A cracked little shrine I still drag
Desert dreams tangled in vines
Two different deaths of the same life

[Chorus]
Blood on the playa
Buried in the selva
All of our yesterdays
Sink where the wild rains swell up
You called it forever
Whispered it
Then ran faster
Now every echo of your name
Is a ghost in the canopy
Canta
Blood on the playa
Buried in the selva
