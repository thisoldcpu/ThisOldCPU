Lyrics for Love Songs To Twerk To by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Verse 1]
You walked in
Whole room tilted
White tee
Gold chain
Yeah
I felt it
You said "hi"
And my hips said "prove it"
Heartbeat hittin' like
"let's get stupid" (hey!)

[Chorus]
This that love song to twerk to
Hands on me while I work you (work you)
Slow grind
Then I drop on two
Tell me what that heart gon' do
This that love song to twerk to
Kiss on my neck when the hook come through
If you catch
I might choose you
Turnin' all this crush into voodoo (oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
You talk sweet
But your hands talk sweeter
Spin me round
Pull me in
Hold me deeper
You say "chill"
I say "make me"
We in the dark
Gettin' reckless
Gettin' achy (mm)

[Chorus]
This that love song to twerk to
Hands on me while I work you (work you)
Slow grind
Then I drop on two
Tell me what that heart gon' do
This that love song to twerk to
Kiss on my neck when the hook come through
If you catch
I might choose you
Turnin' all this crush into voodoo

[Bridge]
Talk nice
Or don't talk at all
Show me
You can catch my fall
If you hold my waist
When the world go wild
I might give you
More than a smile (yeah)

[Chorus]
This that love song to twerk to
Hands on me while I work you
Slow grind
Then I drop on two
Tell me what that heart gon' do
This that love song to twerk to
Kiss on my neck when the hook come through
If you catch
I might choose you
Turn this little fling into "I do"
