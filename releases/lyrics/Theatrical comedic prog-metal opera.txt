Theatrical comedic prog-metal opera: male vocals, monologue verses over staccato odd-meter riffs. Pre-chorus: rapid key modulations, synth bass growl drop, choppy vocal chops. Final chorus: triumphant arena metal, stacked choirs, harmonized guitars, clean counter-melodies, reverb-drenched last-minute key change. Soaring, clean, harmonized.
