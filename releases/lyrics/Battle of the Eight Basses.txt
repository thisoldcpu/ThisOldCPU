Battle of the Eight Basses

[Intro]
[low vocal register]Gather
Sinners
In the rafters
Smoke machines and plastic raptors
Choirs chant in Latin-ish
Stagehands slip on fake red "blood"

[Verse 1]
Two drum thrones on a spinning platform
Click tracks fighting for the crown
Seven guitars in feathered capes now
Tuning
Posturing
Staring down
Eight bass players in the dungeon
Tied to amps with glowing cords
Every riff a declaration
Every note a "sacred sword"

[Chorus]
This is the battle of the eight basses
Seven screaming axes
Melting faces
Twin kits thundering like vengeful gods
Crowd fists raised in confused applause
Battle of the eight basses
Too many strings in too few places
If it’s excessive
Then play it twice
Overblown and over-spiced

[Verse 2]
Guitar 1 steps to the spotlight
Tapping runs that spell his name
Guitar 2 responds in 13
Wrong time signature
Same flame
Three and four form a brief alliance
Harmonized and slightly sharp
Five through seven dive-bomb dive bars
Win the crowd with needless arpeggios

[Pre-Chorus]
Down below
The basses grumble
Octaves rattle metal grates
One by one they start to rumble
Detuned low enough to shake the fates

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[whispered vocals]Silence
Just a hum in the fluorescent void
House lights flicker
Time implodes
[drop to half-time]
The kick stutters
The snare shatters into grains of sand

[Dubstep Breakdown]
[chopped vocals]“EIGHT… BASS… BASS… BASS…”
Wobble like a sinking church bell
Floorboards ripple
Glasses yell
Guitars freeze as glitching statues
Drums sliced up in jagged squares
Basslines coil like iron serpents
Lurching down the basement stairs
Crowd in slow-mo
Jaws all dropping
Laser grids in emerald fog
Every downbeat feels like orbit
Every pause a cosmic "…wait for it…"

[Drop]
[crescendo]
All eight basses hit one note
The universe splits at the throat
Lights cut out
Single scream
"PLAY SOMETHING WE CAN EVEN STREAM"

[Chorus]
[snap back to blazing tempo]

[Finale]
Key change up
Then up once more
Choir of dudes in denim roar
Cheesy lyrics about redemption
Rhyming "fire" with "desire" again
Clean guitar like holy water
Shimmering across the din
Pyro bursts in perfect 7
Tour accountant faints with grin

[gigantic key change]
Battle of the eight basses
Final warning
Every note a flag of scorning
We’ll ride this chord till power fails
Triumphant
Tacky
Metal fairy tale

[Outro]
Last chord held a little longer
Than the patience of the sound tech’s soul
Feedback halo
Ringing thunder
Someone trips and kicks a tom
Curtain falls
The crowd still shouting
"ONE MORE DROP" as house lights rise
The eight bass players pack their cases
Already plotting their reprise
