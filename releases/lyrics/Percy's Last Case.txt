Lyrics for Percy's Last Case by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

Rain in my cuffs
Trench coat torn at the seams
Coffee gone cold
Case file built out of dreams
Streetlamp halos
Over chalk lines and smoke
Her name on the folder
Her picture the joke

Percy
You clown
Talking back to the mirror
Ask it who did it
The answer grows nearer
Seven bad habits
Seven shadows that trail
Seven cheap bottles
All pointing to fail

This is Percy’s last case
Cards on the table
Chips in the gutter
Every clue’s my own face
Gun in the drawer and a tremor in the shutter
If I crack this curse tonight
Maybe I walk out of this place
Or I vanish in the neon rain
On Percy’s last case

Phones that don’t ring
Still somehow accuse
Typewriter letters
Bleeding yesterday’s news
Everyone’s guilty
That’s the joke on the street
Even the footprints
Match the soles on my feet

[low vocal register]
Seven dead ends in a spiral stair
Every locked room has my coat on a chair
Every alibi sounds like my voice
Like I wrote the script
Like I pulled the choice

This is Percy’s last case
Cards on the table
Chips in the gutter
Every clue’s my own face
Gun in the drawer and a tremor in the shutter
If I crack this curse tonight
Maybe I walk out of this place
Or I vanish in the neon rain
On Percy’s last case

Name on the file… P–P–Percy
Evidence loop… loop… loop
Killer is… is… is…

I’m the mark
I’m the knife
I’m the body in the dark
I’m the life

Floorboards buckle
Ceilings bend
Gravity stutters
Streets descend
World goes sideways
Teeth of the bass
Gnaw through the city
Chew up my face

Wobble like a bad heart
Stutter like a last breath
Sirens in a blender
Dancing on my death
Rain becomes an ink storm
Filing cabinets roar
Every secret I’ve been hiding
Vomits through the floor

Suspect: Percy Vail
Charge: Breathing while broken
Verdict: Comic failure
Sentence: Never spoken

Raise the blinds
Let the blue tape fall
I sign my own confession
On the office wall
Gang of ghosts behind me
Shouting out my name
If I’m the final victim
I’m also to blame

This is Percy’s last case
Cards on the table
Chips in the gutter
Every clue’s my own face
Gun in the drawer and a tremor in the shutter
If I crack this curse tonight
Maybe I walk out of this place
Or I vanish in the neon rain
On Percy’s last case
