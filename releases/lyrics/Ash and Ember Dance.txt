Lyrics for Ash and Ember Dance by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Verse 1]
Dust on my tongue
Red stone in my hand
Footprints in circles
Drawn in the cracked dry sand

Smoke from the fire
Paint on my tired face
Old words in a new mouth
Trying to find their place

[Chorus]
This is our ash and ember dance
Heart on the drum
We take the chance (hey!)
Calling the thunder in our bones
Laugh as we stumble
Finding home

Oh
This ash and ember dance
Hands in the air
We break the trance (woah)
Tearing the night from edge to edge
Sing till the dawn climbs over the ledge

[Verse 2]
Names in the dust
Wind comes and makes them stray
I breathe in the silence
Let the sky answer what I can’t say

Your laugh like a flare
Cuts through the gather of gloom
Joy in the middle of ruin
Flower in a ruined room

[Chorus]
This is our ash and ember dance
Heart on the drum
We take the chance (hey!)
Calling the thunder in our bones
Laugh as we stumble
Finding home

Oh
This ash and ember dance
Hands in the air
We break the trance (woah)
Tearing the night from edge to edge
Sing till the dawn climbs over the ledge

[Bridge]
Round and around
Bare feet pound the ground
(spinning, spinning)
Sweat on our skin
Let the wild flood in
(hey! hey!)

Voices collide
River becomes a tide
(shout it, shout it)
Grief
Joy
Fear
Everything’s welcome here

[Chorus]
This is our ash and ember dance
Heart on the drum
We take the chance (hey!)
Calling the thunder in our bones
Laugh as we stumble
Finding home

Oh
This ash and ember dance
Hands in the air
We break the trance (woah)
Tearing the night from edge to edge
Sing till the dawn climbs over the ledge

[Outro]
When the coals glow low
And the last song thins
I carry the dust of tonight
On my breath
On my skin

One final shout
Thrown to the open sky
If I forget this fire
Let the earth remind me why
