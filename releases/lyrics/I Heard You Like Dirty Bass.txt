I Heard You Like Dirty Bass

[Intro]
You said you like it filthy
You said you like it rough
You said you like that pressure
Can you take this much? (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Shots lined up on the table
Lipstick smeared on the glass
You keep talking ’bout trouble
I’m just talking ’bout that—
Back bend
Hands on the speaker
Sweat print soaking your lace
You said you like it deeper
I heard you like dirty bass

[Chorus]
I heard you like dirty bass
Let it hit you in the face
All that pretty talk erased
When you feel that dirty bass
Grab my shirt
Don’t be polite
Scratch my back
I’ll grab your waist
You said you like staying up late
I heard you like dirty—dirty bass

[Verse 2]
Whisper close to my earlobe
Tell me what you want done
You keep throwing that body
Like you’re tryna hurt someone
Nails in my neck
You’re a problem
Tongue on my skin
No shame
Every time that low end drops
You keep moaning out my name (yeah)

[Chorus]
I heard you like dirty bass
Let it hit you in the face
All that pretty talk erased
When you feel that dirty bass
Bite your lip
Ride that wave
You don’t wanna be saved
You said you like staying up late
I heard you like dirty—dirty bass

[Bridge]
Turn the lights down
Bend it low (bend it low)
You keep asking for a harder roll (harder, harder)
If you’re talking freak
Then say it straight
If you’re talking freak
Then back it on my—

[Chorus]
I heard you like dirty bass
Let it hit you in the face
All that halo shit displaced
When you feel that dirty bass
Hands up high
Ass down
You’re the queen of this place
You said you like staying up late
I heard you like dirty—dirty bass (oh yeah)
