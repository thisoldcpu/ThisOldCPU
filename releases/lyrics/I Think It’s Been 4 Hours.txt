I Think It’s Been 4 Hours (Should We Call Someone?)

So…
We’ve been in this IKEA maze
Since brunch
I’ve seen that lamp
Four times
It knows my name now
You said
“Short cut through wardrobes”
Now Narnia’s asking for rent
My cart has three fake plants
And a growing sense of dread

Is this the same display?
Or another time loop layout?
“Follow the arrows
” you said
The arrows follow us
Walls of smiling couples
Perfect couches
Matching cups
I lost my will to choose
At “white
Off-white
Or eggshell?”

I think it’s been 4 hours
Should we call someone?
Tell them we were brave
But the rugs have won
If I vanish in a sea of chairs
Know I went down proud
Write “Missing in the Kitchen Zone”
In big bold font out loud

We passed the café
Twice
Each time
Same meatball sign
Same kid mid–tantrum
Same guy guarding a single spoon
My phone’s at 3 percent
Your hope’s at 2
The exit’s on the map
But the map’s on a pillow
On a bed
In THIS room

You say
“It’s just upstairs”
We’ve been upstairs
Since 2010
The clocks all read different times
But none of them say “home”
If I start naming the shelving
Just drag me to the light
I swore I heard an angel sing
It was a blender demo on repeat

I think it’s been 4 hours
Should we call someone?
Tell them we were brave
But the rugs have won
If I vanish in a sea of chairs
Know I went down proud
Write “Missing in the Kitchen Zone”
In big bold font out loud

Listen…
If we don’t make it
Delete my browsing history of:
“Can you live inside a showroom?”
“Can you plant real trees
In fake plant pots?”
“Emergency exits for emotional damage”
If civilization falls
They’ll find our skeletons posed
On a matching sectional
Price tag still attached

I see daylight… or a lightbulb
I see freedom… or a sale
Is that fresh air
Or scented candles?
Your hand in mine
Our cart piled high
If we ever escape
I’m never buying furniture again

I think it’s been 4 hours
Should we call someone?
Tell them we were brave
But the rugs have won
If we make it past the plants tonight
We’ll be legends
Love
Put our faces by the sliding doors
“Survivors of Aisle 12” above

If they ask how long we wandered
Just say
“Long enough to learn”
That true commitment’s tested
Where the exits never turn

I think it’s been 4 hours…

We should probably call someone
