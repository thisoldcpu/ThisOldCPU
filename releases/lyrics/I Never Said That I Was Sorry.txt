Lyrics for I Never Said That *I* Was Sorry by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Intro]
[whispered vocals]
Curtain up
Teeth of gears all grinding
House lights fade
Hear my name in the lightning

[Verse 1]
You made a saint out of your side of it
Framed my face in the ash like a monument
Pinned every shard of your hurt to my chest
Signed my name in the blood of your narrative

You raised a glass to my guilty grin
Told the crowd I confessed every secret sin
But roll the tape back
Frame by frame
You’ll never find the words you keep carving in my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go
Step by step up the scale
It’s dizzy
Every chord
Clawing at the sky
So busy
If I fall
It’ll be in flames
Not pity
Hear it in the choir as they say

[Chorus]
I never said that *I* was sorry
You just liked the sound of the story
You wrote my lines in your bedroom mirror
Screamed them till the echoes felt like truth

I never signed your confession
You mistook my silence for admission
If there’s a crown for who played victim better
You can keep it
I’m not bending for you

[Verse 2]
You put a halo on your every bruise
Used every crack in the glass as a perfect excuse
Called my name like a spell in a crowded room
Then swore you heard me beg under a paper moon

But I was backstage
Lacing armor tight
Carving “I decline” in the prompter light
You fed the choir with a counterfeit script
While I tuned every string for the day it would rip

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel it rise
Every note another floor higher
Breath runs short
But the rage feeds the choir
If I choke
It’ll be on my own fire
Hear my battle line as I say

[Chorus]
I never said that *I* was sorry
You just liked the shape of the story
You stitched my face on your favorite villain
Held me up so you could play the saint

I never signed your confession
You translated quiet as submission
If there’s a throne for the best revision
Take your bow
I’ll walk out of the frame

[Bridge]
[low vocal register]
I won’t kneel for a script I never read
Won’t bleed on command just to paint your regret
You want a martyr?
Write your own name in red

[choir swells]
You want a martyr?
Write your own name in red

[dubstep break
Glitchy choir chops
Guitars syncopating]
Twist the words
Let the bassline mock it
Every “sorry” you forged
Hear the floorboards drop it

[Pre-Chorus]
Climb again
Every chord a loaded question
“Will you break?”
You keep chanting like a weapon
But my spine
Is a staircase made of lessons
Hear the walls respond when I say

[Chorus]
I never said that *I* was sorry
You just loved the taste of the glory
You poured my name in your holy chalice
Drank it down and called it proof

I never signed your confession
You can choke on every false revision
If there’s a god of twisted memory
They’re applauding what you turned me into

[Final Chorus – key change
Gang vocals]
[ganged vocals
Arena roar]
I never said that *I* was sorry
(never, never)
But I’m done being cast as the quarry
(no more running)
Turn up the lights
Let the crowd see clearly
Who’s been pulling every string

I never signed your confession
(tear it, burn it)
This is my last intercession
(choir: “stand up, stand up”)
If there’s a legend written after this night
It’ll say I walked out
Head high in the spite

[guitar solo
Triumphant harmonized leads over clean arpeggios]
