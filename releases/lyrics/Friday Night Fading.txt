Friday Night Fading

[Verse 1]
Buzzing bulbs
cheap bleachers shake
Cold metal bench
paper plate steak
Whistle in my ear
heart off-time
Whole week heavy
but the sky looks prime

[Chorus]
Friday night lights
they burn my eyes
Every scar shows
I don’t hide
Old ghosts dance
in the band’s bad tune
Friday night lights
cut right through

[Verse 2]
Secondhand jacket
patch half torn (hah)
Mascot logo
fading like the porn on a dorm wall
Concession smoke
in my throat like glass
Cheering for a town
that forgot my ass

[Chorus]
Friday night lights
they burn my eyes
Every scar shows
I don’t hide
Old ghosts dance
in the band’s bad tune
Friday night lights
cut right through (yeah, right through)

[Bridge]
Ugly voice
cracks on the word “stay” (stay)
Laugh in my lungs
but it sounds like decay
You hear broken
I hear proof I’m alive
Under busted bulbs
I still arrive

[Chorus]
Friday night lights
they burn my eyes
Every scar shows
I don’t hide
Old ghosts dance
in the band’s bad tune
Friday night lights
cut right through (cut right through)
Friday night lights
I choke, then bloom
