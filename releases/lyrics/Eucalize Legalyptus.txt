Eucalize Legalyptus

[Verse 1]
You walked in smelling like
Court dates and forests
Briefcase full of mint green leaves
And highlighted sources
"Sign here
Breathe deep
It’s all above board"
You said
"I make your lungs feel right
And keep me from being bored"

[Chorus]
Eucalize Legalyptus
Put that stamp on my chest
Make it all legit
Just
Breathe it in
Let the red tape lift us
Paper
Pen
Little grin
Yeah we’re in this (hey!)
Eucalize Legalyptus
Turn my everyday ache into gentle justice
If they ask what kind of spell is this
It’s strictly business
Baby
Eucalize Legalyptus

[Verse 2]
You file my fears
In color-coded piles
Soothe my stress with vapor trails
And those sideways smiles
You said
"I don’t do magic
I just do forms"
But every time you say my name
It changes all my norms

[Chorus]
Eucalize Legalyptus
Put that stamp on my chest
Make it all legit
Just
Breathe it in
Let the red tape lift us
Paper
Pen
Little grin
Yeah we’re in this (oh yeah)
Eucalize Legalyptus
Turn my everyday ache into gentle justice
If they ask what kind of spell is this
It’s strictly business
Baby
Eucalize Legalyptus

[Bridge]
[Claps and bass only]
Sign on the line
Initial here
You wrote "forever"
In tiny letters under "clear" (woah)
I coughed once
Laughed twice
Said
"Is this allowed?"
You said
"Relax
We’re perfectly
Compliant to be loud"

[Chorus]
Eucalize Legalyptus
Put that stamp on my chest
Make it all legit
Just
Breathe it in
Let the red tape lift us
Paper
Pen
Little grin
Yeah we’re in this
Eucalize Legalyptus
Turn my everyday ache into gentle justice
If they ask what kind of spell is this
Tell them we’re licensed lovers
