Bertrand’s Razor

[Verse 1]
They talk like weather reports
Clear skies
Forever
Of course
They bet the house on a hunch
Call it truth
Call it lunch

I circle words in my head
Lay awake
Re-reading what I said
Measure twice
Still scared to cut
Heart in gear
Hands in a rut

[Chorus]
Bertrand’s razor
Sharp little phrase
Cuts through the crowd on the loudest days
The ones sure of everything
Shout it out proud
The wise ones whisper
Drowning in doubt
(yeah)
The wise ones whisper
Drowning in doubt

[Verse 2]
He thumps his glass on the bar
Says he’s got the world in a jar
Maps drawn in permanent ink
Never once wonders what he can’t think

I’ve got questions in my coat
Folded like secret notes
Every answer I unfold
Turns to ash before it’s told

[Chorus]
Bertrand’s razor
Sharp little phrase
Cuts through the crowd on the loudest days
The ones sure of everything
Shout it out proud
The wise ones whisper
Drowning in doubt
(oh, they’re drowning)
The wise ones whisper
Drowning in doubt

[Bridge]
Maybe certainty’s a cheaper wine
Goes down fast
Feels fine
Doubt is a bitter
Careful brew
Slow on the tongue
But closer to true

[Chorus]
Bertrand’s razor
Sharp little phrase
Cuts through the crowd on the loudest days
The room loves the easy
Loves the bold and loud
While the careful hearts keep counting clouds
(so many clouds)
The careful hearts keep counting clouds

[Outro]
Raise your glass
To the ones who ask how
The trouble with the world
Might save it somehow
