This shit is stupid (And I am not OK)

Tiny room
Big brain storm
Duct-taped heart
On a discount throne
I open my mouth
And a freight train falls out

I spilled my soul on a group chat screen
Got three skull emojis and a sticker of a frog
Doctor says “breathe”
Therapist says “journal”
I say “sure”
Then I scream into a drive-thru bag

Everyone’s fine
Everyone’s FINE
Smiling like a spreadsheet
Dead inside

This shit is stupid
And I am not OK
Tried to act human
But I glitched halfway
If life’s a lesson
I missed the day
This shit is stupid
And I am not OK

Rent due yesterday
Card declined today
Boss says “we’re a family”
Then cuts my shift in half
Friends getting married
Dogs
Diplomas
Pretty little plans
I got five alarms
And a sink of cans

Told my mom
“I’m tired of pretending”
She sent a link
To a podcast
About gratitude

Eight guitars circle like vultures
Divebomb scales in a carnival spin
Seven low strings answer from the basement
Bent so far they almost snap
Then grin

Everything drops
Like someone kicked the cable
Just my raw breath
And a halfway swallowed curse

Then—
My panic attack
Becomes a cartoon monster
Jaw made of sub
Eyes made of strobe
It chews my voice
Spits it back in fragments
“not okay — not okay — kay — kay —”
Walls melt
Floor bucks
Brain skanks in the rubble
I laugh so hard
I almost feel alive

Snap back in
Crowd of ghosts in my mirror
Fists up high
Like we’re saving the world
Same dumb words
But they hit like a hammer
