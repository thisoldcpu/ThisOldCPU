Galactic Tax Audit Of The Doom Emperor

[Intro]
[theatrical baritone]
In the year
Two billion
Brunch
The stars run on service fees
And sneezes are itemized

On a throne
Of platinum receipts
The Doom Emperor calculates
How many planets he can write off

[Verse 1]
He audits asteroids
For “excess sparkle”
Fines a moon
For sentimental rings

Sends a comet
A strongly worded invoice
For dramatic entrances
During eclipse season

His quill?
A screaming neutron star
Dipped in molten ink
Of overdue outrage

[Chorus]
Galactic tax audit of the Doom Emperor
Every breath
A deductible crime
Did you file your feelings in quadruplicate?
You’ll be fined
You’ll be fined
You’ll be fi-i-i-iined!

[Verse 2]
He kicks in the door
Of a humble black hole
“Show me your earnings
From swallowed universes”

Little nebula
Hides her piggy bank of photons
He inventories each sparkle
Names them “contraband joy”

He repossesses
A teenager’s hoverboard
For “unreported vibes”
And backdates the penalty to birth

[Pre-Chorus]
[building
Gang vocals]
Itemize your tiny thrills
Count your crumbs and petty chills
Sign here
Here
Here
And here
(in your own existential fear)

[Chorus]

[Dubstep Breakdown]
[cavernous drop
Chopped screams]
“SUB-MISSION… MISSING… MIS…”
[vocals glitch
Pitch-stutter]
Submit submit sub-mit sub—
[sub drop detonates]
WUB-WUB-WUB
[fragmented highs]
“WHERE… ARE… YOUR… RECEIP—E—E—E—TS?”
[chopped into percussive gasps]
Re-ceipts / heat / eats / ee-eee-eep
[baritone
Distant]
Line forty-two:
“state the purpose of your soul”
[soul… soul… soul… echoes into bass lurch]

[Bridge]
[ascending hysteria]
He audits dreams
For unauthorized hope
Slaps a tariff
On spontaneous hugs

Charges interest
On uncollected apologies
Forgets his own
Then compounds it monthly

Galactic court
Made of spinning office chairs
Jury of twelve
Identical interns

[Chorus]
[full arena
Octave-up power highs]

[Final Coda]
[key change
Absurdly triumphant]
Raise your pens
Like flaming swords
Wave your forms
In holy rows

We declare
A refund on fear
Retroactive
To the big bang year

[gothic gang vocals]
“WE OWE NOTHING
BUT RIDICULOUS JOY”
Baritone roars
“VOID THE VOID!”

Last note holds
For seventeen bars
[power highs
Chorus cleans
Gang shouts colliding]
As the Emperor cries
“I MISCLAIMED MY HEART!”
