Lyrics for Poshaiyankya’s Bargain & Awonawilona’s Response by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Verse 1]
Four corncobs
Laid on woven reed
Smoke curls sideways
Watching what I plead

I say
"Hear me
Maker of the dark and dawn
I bring my hunger
Trade me a bigger sun"

The sand holds still
Even my breath feels loud
Your name on my tongue
Tastes like a gathering cloud

[Chorus]
Awonawilona
I speak in sparks
Small fire
Small hands
Small heart
You rumble back from the rim of the sky
"What will you give
For what you ask of my light?"
Awonawilona
Your thunder replies
Calling my promise out of the dust
I say
"I will gamble my name
My time"
You say
"Risk is the road
Between your seed and my design"

[Verse 2]
I offer stories
I have yet to live
Children laughing
That I long to give

A trail of footprints
Leading past my fear
I push my corncobs forward
Pull my future near

Your wind circles
Tugging at my sleeve
"Little speaker of the clay
What are you ready to leave?"

[Chorus]
Awonawilona
I speak in sparks
Small fire
Small hands
Small heart
You rumble back from the rim of the sky
"What will you trade
For all you dream might rise?"
Awonawilona
Your thunder replies
Shaking the sand in my eyes
I say
"I will wager my comfort
My sleep"
You say
"Risk is the bridge
From your dust to what you keep"

[Bridge]
[Call] "Will you lift me
Past this narrow field?"
[Response] "Plant your courage
Where the stars are tilled"

[Call] "If I stumble
Will you carry me through?"
[Response] "Fall
And the falling
Is how I carry you"

[Call] "If I lose it all
Is the bargain undone?"
[Response] "You never owned
Even the weight of one grain
My son"

[Chorus]
Awonawilona
I burn in your words
Bare feet over embers
Over worlds
You thunder back
Many voices
One sky
"Risk is the tide
That pulls your prayer to my side"
Awonawilona
I answer in dust
Palms open
Empty of trust and of doubt
"I give what I am
Not what I own"
You say
"Then step
And the cosmos becomes your home"

[Outro]
Drumbeats slow
Heart echo
Echo
Corncobs waiting
For the first new glow

I whisper
"Teacher
I am small as sand"
Your silence lifts
My eyes
My hands

Flute-line fading
Into endless blue
Risk
Divinity
The turning world
All breathing
Through you
