Secondhand Groove

[Verse 1]
Found your jacket in my backseat
Smelled like arguments and cheap perfume
You left lipstick on my rearview
Now every red light looks like you

[Pre-Chorus]
You said we’d keep it grown
Keep it honest
But you were busy playing favorites
Baby
I kept the groove steady like a promise
You kept changing up the tempo on me

[Chorus]
You turned my love into a secondhand groove
Worn-out moves
Same old tune
Spun me around till I fell out of step
Now I dance alone
But I dance my best
You turned my heart into a used-up tune
But I still move
I still move

[Verse 2]
All our photos in a thrift-store frame
Left them leaning by the kitchen door
You took the plants
Left the coffee stains
Guess that’s all I ever was
Decor

[Pre-Chorus]
You kept your phone facedown on the table
Smiled like everything was fine
Yeah maybe
I read the credits when I was able
Saw my name fade out slowly
Baby

[Chorus]
You turned my love into a secondhand groove
Worn-out moves
Same old tune
Spun me around till I fell out of step
Now I dance alone
But I dance my best
You turned my heart into a used-up tune
But I still move
I still move

[Bridge]
Now my friends say
"Let it go
Let it slide"
But the hurt hits right on the one
Every time
I let your memory fade into the background singers
Just an echo on a line that never lingers

[Chorus]
You turned my love into a secondhand groove
Worn-out moves
Same old tune
Spun me around till I fell out of step
Now I dance alone
But I dance my best
You turned my heart into a used-up tune
But I still move
I still move
