Marimba in the Pit

[Intro]
Click of the sticks
Dust in the air
Hands on the bars
Teeth on the snare

[Verse 1]
Carved wood
Scarred hands
We tune the storm
By command
Heat in the hall
Crowd like a wave
I count it in
You misbehave

[Chorus]
Marimba in the pit
Let the hammers hit
Wood and metal split
Can you handle it
Marimba in the pit
Feel the floor transmit
Every shaken bit
Yeah
We’re built for it

[Verse 2]
Blood-red
Stage lights
I ride that line
Between wrong and right
Thumb
Mallet
Pulse in my jaw
I drop that run
You drop your jaw

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[low vocal register]
Left side
Right side
Bare feet
Hard ground
Heartbeat
War sound
We don’t slow down
[gang vocals]
One note
One shout
Breathe in
Black out

[Chorus]
