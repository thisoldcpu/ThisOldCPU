Lyrics for Why Are You In My Bathroom by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Intro]
[spoken
Absurdly dramatic]
Who dares disturb
My sacred porcelain throne?

[Verse 1]
I rise
From the foam of the shower
Conditioner crown
Dripping down my eyes
To find a stranger
Posed by the towel tower
Holding my loofah
Like some cursed prize

Toothpaste scepter in my hand
I demand your explanation
Why are you lurking by the fan
In this tiled abomination?
You tracked in socks
You broke the spell
This room is mine
Can’t you tell?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is consecrated ground
Ceramic halls
Echoing sound
Why are you in my bathroom?
Why are you in my bathroom?

[Chorus]
Why are you in my bathroom?!
This is not a public throne
Is this a side quest
Fever dream
Or
Did you raid the wrong home?
I’m in a towel
You’re in my space
Foam on my beard
War paint on my face
Why are you in my bathroom?!
Answer me
Before I rinse this place

[Verse 2]
You say
“Wrong door
Dude
I was guessing”
How did you pass
Three pics of my dog?
You brushed past candles
Labeled “Private Blessing”
Ignored the plunger
Like a mythic log

My rubber ducky stares in shock
As you lean on the laundry basket
You treat my shampoo like fine stock
Sniffing every plastic casket
This is a temple
Tiled and bright
Not your backstage greenroom tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
This is sacred steamy air
Mint and citrus
Handled with care
Why are you in my bathroom?
Why are you in my bathroom?

[Chorus]
Why are you in my bathroom?!
This is not a backstage bar
There is no guest list on the mirror
You are not a star
I’m half-soaked titan
Robe askew
Armed with a can of shampoo
Why are you in my bathroom?!
Face your fate
In eucalyptus doom

[Bridge]
[choir
Mock-epic]
O-o-o-oh
The curtain rod shall bend
O-o-o-oh
Tile and grout defend

[low vocal register]
I am the guardian
Of every cracked blue tile
Warden of the shower drain
Judge of every toothbrush trial

[full band
Breakdown with glitchy drops]
You hear that drip drip
That’s the clock on your life
Hear the fan spin
Like the wheel of strife
Hear the bass drop
As the lights all strobe
I banish you now
From my porcelain globe

[whispered vocals over drop]
Wrong. Door
Wrong. Dimension
Wrong. Bathroom
New convention

[Pre-Chorus]
Step away from the medicine shelf
Before you meet your foamy self
Why are you in my bathroom?
Why are you in my bathroom?

[Chorus]
[gang shouts
Key change]
Why are you in my bathroom?!
Choirs shake the shower glass
May every awkward house party
Remember this trespass
I plant my foot
I claim this land
Loofah raised in soapy hand
Why are you in my bathroom?!
Sing it loud
As the echoes crash

[Chorus]
[key change up
Final]
[Chorus]
