Ketamine Vape

[Verse 1]
Doctor in a lab coat
With a fog machine
Clipboard full of side effects
And my insurance dream
He says
"Son
Your brain's a browser
Seventy tabs ablaze
You need a little forced logout
From your modern malaise"

I say
"Will I see the cosmos
Or just text my ex?"
He says
"Probably both
My friend"
Checks "very complex"
Nurse wheels in a foggy pod
Like a budget starship
Sticker on the side reads
"Live
Laugh
Dissociate" in Comic Sans script

[Pre-Chorus]
[glitchy vocal chops] "inhale–exhale–who am I?–hey!"
Stairs of keys under my feet
Keep changing shape
Floor turns sideways
Ceiling tastes like grape
Teeth become maracas
Heart becomes a bass
Name loading
Spinning wheel
Buffering face

[Chorus]
Ketamine vape
I'm a discount nebula
Lying on the clinic bed
Wearing paper regalia
Ketamine vape
Therapist counting to eight
I'm arguing with gravity
About our scheduled break
Oh
Ketamine vape
My trauma doing stand‑up
In a velvet cape
Crowd surf the couch
On a chemical wave
Saint of the sideways
Ketamine vape

[Verse 2]
Time slows to a slideshow
Of deeply bad haircuts
Every awful voicemail
Every "reply all" gut punch
My high school crush appears
Wearing my worst tweets
Reads them like gospel
To a choir of receipts

My ego's on a TED Talk stage
Laser pointer
Pie chart
Showing all the times I said "I'm fine"
While falling apart
Then the clicker melts
Mic stand bows
Stage peels back
I'm just a guy in funny socks
On a vinyl couch snack attack

[Pre-Chorus]
[low vocal register
Building] Numbers
Colors
Inside jokes
Shuffle like a deck
Names of every ex and pet
Spinning at my neck
[rapid key modulations]
Room goes cartoon
Then courtroom
Then
My childhood driveway gate
[growling synth bass drop]
Voice in Dolby Atmos asks:
"Is it you
Or just the weight?"

[Chorus]
Ketamine vape
I'm a discount nebula
Lying on the clinic bed
Wearing paper regalia
Ketamine vape
Therapist counting to eight
I'm arguing with gravity
About our scheduled break
Oh
Ketamine vape
My trauma doing stand‑up
In a velvet cape
Crowd surf the couch
On a chemical wave
Saint of the sideways
Ketamine vape

[Bridge]
[spoken
Theatrically outraged over chugging riff]
Wait
Wait
Wait—
If I'm not my thoughts
And I'm not my pain
And I'm not that one text
Sent at 3 a.m. insane
Am I just
A meat mech
For a cosmic inside joke?
A rental car for consciousness
With mystery smoke?

[half‑sung]
What if I'm
Forgiven
Already
By the me I haven't met yet?
What if I'm
Allowed to be messy
And still pay rent?

[Final Chorus]
[crescendo
Stacked choirs
Harmonized guitars]
Ketamine vape
Now the ceiling cracks open
But it's sunlight and dumb hope
Pouring through my chest
Golden
Ketamine vape
All my worst nights in a frame
Hanging in a hallway
In a house that knows my name
Ketamine vape
Choirs on the rafters
Singing "you can stay"
Drums like a heartbeat
Finding steady
Finding brave
[reverb‑drenched key change
Soaring vocal]
Saint of the sideways
Guide me back
Back to shape
I take one breath
Hear myself laugh
"I'm okay"

[Chorus]
