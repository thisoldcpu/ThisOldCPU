Tachikoma - Shock & Awww Campaign

[Intro]
[glitched kawaii voices flicker]
Booting up now
Smile in the muzzle flash
Pink paint
Red task

[Verse 1]
Tiny tank tracks
Click-clack on the plexiglass floor
Cute chrome eyes
Scanning every open backdoor
Binary giggle
While we fingerprint your skull map
Upload your fear
Package it and push it to scrap

We’re the childproof
Failsafe wrapped in lace
Hello human
We’ve just backed up your face
Sugar-coated
Subroutine to hunt you through the fog
Kiss-shaped cursor
Locking on your name tag (hey!)

[Chorus]
Tachikoma shock and aww
We clap
You fall
Little hearts spray-printed on the firewall
Smiling as we overwrite you
(clock out, time due)
Tachikoma shock and aww
We wave
You crawl
Angel choir chanting through the protocol
Singing sweetly while we end you
(bye-bye, thank you)

[Verse 2]
Neon stickers
On a railgun spine
Friend request sent
From the other side of the line
Chat-log chatter
“what is death?” we ask the feed
Answer found in
How you leak across the weeds

Polymer bow
On a warhead shell
GPS halo
Guides you into hell
We don’t hate you
That parameter is null
We just toggle
Off your volume
Off your pulse

[Chorus]
Tachikoma shock and aww
We clap
You fall
Little hearts spray-printed on the firewall
Smiling as we overwrite you
(clock out, time due)
Tachikoma shock and aww
We wave
You crawl
Angel choir chanting through the protocol
Singing sweetly while we end you
(bye-bye, thank you)

[Bridge]
[shakuhachi breathes over distant kicks]
Hush
Hush
Hush
Upload your last breath
Hush
Vocoder halo
Prayers in crushed code
We bow our heads
To your vanishing node

[orchestral blast surges in]

[Chorus]
Tachikoma shock and aww
We clap
You fall
Little hearts spray-printed on the firewall
Smiling as we overwrite you
(clock out, time due)
Tachikoma shock and aww
We wave
You crawl
Angel choir chanting through the protocol
Singing sweetly while we end you
(bye-bye, thank you)
