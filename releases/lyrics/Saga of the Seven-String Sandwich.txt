Saga of the Seven-String Sandwich

[Intro]
[whispered vocals]
In a land of too much volume
On a mountain made of cabs
Stood a council of musicians
Arguing about who slaps

[Verse 1]
First came the drummers
Two thrones
One stage
Left foot
Right foot
Starting up a quake
Double kicks dueling
Like they’re late for work
Crashing into cymbals
With a righteous smirk

Next
Eight guitars
In a circle of flame
Each one swore
They’d redefine “insane”
Neck-thru warriors
Tuning down in rage
Trem bars trembling
Like a dragon in a cage

[Pre-Chorus]
Seven basses lurking
Tuned so low they bend time
Growling in the shadows
“Feel the fundamental grind”

[Chorus]
This is the battle of the bands… in one band
Too many strings for a mortal hand
Who will conquer this ridiculous land?
We tune down
We chug hard
We overplay and we take it too far
Raise your fist if you don’t understand
Battle of the bands… in one band

[Verse 2]
The first guitar screams
“With twenty-seven notes a bar”
Second one replies
“With a solo from the stars”
Third shreds arpeggios
Fourth taps behind his head
Fifth just plays one bent note
But he holds it till it’s dead

Six and seven harmonize
In a spiraling ascent
Eight just dive-bombs
Off the lighting truss
Unbent
Bassists form a circle
Summoning the rumble god
Every note they’re playing
Shakes the venue’s parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
Choirs in Latin
About pizza and despair
Gothic robes swirling
Wind machine in their hair

[Chorus]
This is the battle of the bands… in one band
Too many strings for a mortal hand
Who will conquer this ridiculous land?
We tune down
We chug hard
We overplay and we take it too far
Raise your fist if you don’t understand
Battle of the bands… in one band

[Bridge – Dubstep Breakdown]
[everything cuts out
Then distant vocal]
Wait… what’s that sound?

[half-time drums enter
Filtered]
Tempo melts
Riffs get sliced
Guitars glitch out
Like haunted dice

Bass drops yawning
Floorboards quake
Seven low-end monsters
Learning how to shake

[wobble-heavy drop
Shouted]
Wub-wub warriors
Swing that sub like a sword
Half-step lurching
Crowd thrown overboard

Chopped screams stuttering
Voices turned to code
Twin kits stomp
Like mechs in overload

[growled]
Guitars to lasers
Bass to storms
We break reality
To stay in form

[Build-up]
[snare rolls rising
Choir swelling]
Faster
Louder
Higher
More
We can’t remember
What “subtle” was for

[Chorus – Arena Finale
Key Change]
[everything slams back in
Brighter key
Giant gated reverb]
This is the battle of the bands… in one band
Now in a key we can barely stand
Hands in the air for this glorious scam
We tune up
We shine hard
We overblaze and we take it too far
Sing it so loud that it breaks the stands
Battle of the bands… in one band

[Finale]
[chorus-soaked clean guitars
Gang vocals]
Too
Much
Sound
For a mortal land

[held note
Absurdly long
Choir + lead vocal]
Baaaaaaand…

[guitar solo to blackout]
