/ɪd/ , Ego and Superego

[Verse 1]
[low vocal register]
In the basement of my brain
Something scratches at the chains
Teeth and thunder in the dark
Writing hunger in my heart

Then a mirror splits in three
All my monsters staring back at me
Gold trimmed judge on a crumbling throne
Screaming rules into a broken phone

[Pre-Chorus]
[id] howling
"Take it
Break it"
[ego] whisper
"Wait
Just fake it"
[superego] with the halo blade
"Bleed a little
Kid
But look well-behaved"

[Chorus]
“I am the war inside my skull”
[id
Ego
Superego]
Pulling at the ropes till the bell swings low
[id
Ego
Superego]
Crowd in my head chanting
"Let it go"
But nobody wants to lose control
I am the war inside my skull
[id
Ego
Superego]

[Verse 2]
[id] wants fire on a weekday night
Kiss the chaos
Kill the quiet
Steal the crown
Burn the town
Lick the blood as it drips down

[superego] in a velvet suit
Counting sins like silver loot
Editing every breath I breathe
Polishing the mask over rotting teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
[ego] stuck in the center seat
Both hands tied to a ticking beat
"Can't you two just share this skin?"
Clock says time
And the cracks cave in

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[choir
Call-and-response]
[id:] "I want it
I want it"
[choir:] “You want too much”
[superego:] "You’re guilty
You're filthy"
[choir:] “You judge too much”

[ego
Strained]
I’m the tightrope over acid rain
Every footstep sings “remember the pain”
Every heartbeat
Jury of three
Deadlock hanging from the family tree

[drop – half‑time
Glitchy choir]
[id] goes feral in the breakdown (break down)
Tearing all the temple walls down (walls down)
[superego] drowning in the bass quake
"Hallelujah" with a migraine

[Pre-Chorus]
[climbing modulation
Full choir]
[id] screaming
"Live
Live
Live"
[superego] hissing
"Give
Forgive"
[ego] raising both fractured hands
"I'll be king of my own quicksand"

[Chorus]

[Chorus] [key change
Gang shouts
Soaring harmonies]
