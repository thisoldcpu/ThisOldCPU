You Forgot Your Panties?

You forgot your panties
In my laundry basket
Like a cursed pink banner
Of last night’s chaos

Sunday morning headache
Coffee tastes like guilt and glitter
There they are
Center stage
On my sad apartment floor
Flashback to the dive bar
You
Tequila
Questionable decisions
Now this cotton little monument
Judging all my life choices

You forgot your panties
Now they’re haunting my room like a prophecy
Swinging from the lamp
Like a tiny flag of your anarchy
I’m screaming at the ceiling
“Is this fate or just bad planning?”
You forgot your panties
And my heart’s in full malfunction

Tried to text you smoothly
Typed
Erased
Then overdid it
“Hey
You left some… laundry
Also
Are you into destiny?”
My roommate walks in
Sees the evidence
Starts applauding
Says
“Bro
That’s the universe
Or at least good marketing”

You forgot your panties
Now they’re haunting my room like a prophecy
Swinging from the lamp
Like a tiny flag of your anarchy
I’m screaming at the ceiling
“Is this fate or just bad planning?”
You forgot your panties
And my heart’s in full malfunction

We ride to war
Me and seven angry basses
Eight guitars screaming your name
In harmonized disgrace
Laundry basket battle zone
Sock puppets yelling “coward”
Boxers form a barricade
Your pink ghosts push forward

I stare into the spin cycle
And the spin cycle stares back

Your panties start levitating
Over broken pizza boxes
Laundry demons chanting
In distorted
Chopped-up voices

Pant–pant–pant–panties
For–for–for–forgot your
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pan-ties

I’m drowning in the bass
Ghosts of our bad decisions
Fold me
Crease me
Break me
In fluorescent kitchen vision

Is this love
Or a wardrobe malfunction?
Is this fate
Or just fabric corruption?

You forgot your panties
Crowd is singing like it’s sacred scripture
Phones are in the air
For this cotton-clad adventure
I hold them up like treasure
Under blinding pyro fountains
You forgot your panties
And we turned it into mountains

If we never meet again
At least I’ve got this warning
Love can leave you breathless
Or just underwear by morning
