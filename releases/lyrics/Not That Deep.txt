Lyrics for Not That Deep by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Intro]
[spoken
Mock-ominous]
Gather ‘round
Brave souls
For a saga of
Mild inconvenience
And slightly awkward eye contact

[Verse 1]
I woke up late
By
Like
Ten whole minutes
My coffee ratio
One scoop off perfect
My phone at ninety
Not a hundred percent
How do mortals
Survive this torment

[Verse 2]
The group chat pinged
They made plans without me
(They went for tacos
Two blocks away)
Barista spelled my name
With seven wrong letters
I carried that burden
The rest of the day

[Pre-Chorus]
[staccato
Climbing]
Tiny tremors
In a teaspoon
Petty problems
Swell like typhoons
Each complaint
A cosmic grief
Modulate it
Past belief
[modulating upward every bar]
Up we go
Up again
Change the key
Change the pain
Turn a flinch
To a primal scream
Milking drama
From whipped cream

[Chorus]
It’s not that deep
But I make it an opera
Turn a paper cut
To a prophecy
I raise my fist
At the lukewarm water
Sing a requiem
For my missing hoodie
It’s not that deep
But I belt like it’s destiny
Choirs of chaos
For spilled iced tea
It’s not that deep
Still I roar like a tragedy
Crown me king
Of low-stakes agony

[Verse 3]
I hit a red light
Every single corner
The playlist shuffled
To the one song I skip
Wi‑Fi dropped
At ninety-nine percent loading
Clearly the universe
Is taking the mick

[Pre-Chorus]
[rapid-fire
Mock-heroic]
Minor setback
Major score
Key change
Key change
Three
Then four
Raise the stakes
On petty grief
Treat a typo
Like belief
Every chord
A bigger plea
Stack the thirds
For spilled coffee
Turn annoyance
Into art
Let the drama
Hit the charts

[Chorus]

[Drop]
[growling synth bass
Chopped male vocal samples]
Not that
Not that
Not that deep
[stuttered]
De-e-eep
[half-sung
Half-growled]
Micro crisis
Mega scream
Turn my mood swing
To a laser beam

[Bridge]
[spoken over choral “aaah”]
And lo
The hero stands
Before a vending machine
That ate his last coin
He will press “refund”
He will press it again
He will…
…put in another coin
[sudden full-voice belt]
—This is my saga!
This is my curse!
Paying full price
For feelings that are worse!
I know
I know
It’s barely a blip
But I still wanna
Let this ego rip

[Final Chorus]
[full arena blast
Key up]
It’s not that deep
But I make it an anthem
Every minor slight
Gets a laser show
I swing my cape
At a tiny problem
Like a stage-dived duke
In a budget robe
It’s not that deep
But I shout till the lights shake
Stacked-up choirs
Overblown relief
It’s not that deep
Last key change for drama’s sake
Hold that note
‘Til the nosebleeds bleed

[Final Tag]
[choir-only
Huge reverb]
Not that deep
Not that deep
[solo male voice
Soft and high]
…okay
Maybe
Just a little bit deep
