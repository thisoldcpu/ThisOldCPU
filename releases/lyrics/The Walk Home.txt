Lyrics for The Walk Home by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Verse 1]
Last bell rings
Empty halls breathe out my name
Scuffed shoes drag
Through the flyers and the folding chairs
Locker doors like tombs
Yearbook ghosts that never cared
Phone screen white
But the message thread is bare

[Pre-Chorus]
I count the cracks
Like rosary beads in the concrete
One more step
For every word I didn’t say
Streetlights lean
Like a jury over the crosswalk
Every signal screams
But I still obey

[Chorus]
This is the walk home
Head down
Heart loud
Fists in my coat
Every stare burns holes in my bones
I trace the long road
Past the houses that pretend they don’t know
Every breath says “you’re on your own”
On the walk home

[Verse 2]
Band shirt
Ripped
They laughed till it became a law
Shoved my name
On the bathroom wall in jagged ink
Teacher talked of storms
I memorized the weather map
Knew exactly
When their hands would push me to the brink

[Pre-Chorus]
I pace the blocks
Like circles carved in an old cell
Mailbox flags
All saluting someone else
Trash can thrones
Where they crowned me with their insults
All their broken jokes
Rusting in the wells

[Chorus]
This is the walk home
Head down
Heart loud
Fists in my coat
Every stare burns holes in my bones
I trace the long road
Past the houses that pretend they don’t know
Every breath says “you’re on your own”
On the walk home

[Bridge]
[whispered vocals]
Left
Right
Left
Right
Bite down
Do not cry

[low vocal register]
If I turn around now
Will the shadows keep my place?
If I scream out loud
Will they carve it on my face?

[growled backing]
“Don’t run
Just take it
Don’t run
You’re used to this”

[full voice
Mounting]
But the pavement shakes
Under every cursed prediction
Every bruise they signed
Becomes a breaking benediction

[Pre-Chorus]
Steps get faster
Heart hits harder than their chorus
Muttered names
Falling off my shoulders like old chains
Windows watch
But the glass can’t stand before us
If the world stays still
Then I’ll be the hurricane

[Chorus]
This is the walk home
Head up
Eyes bright
Breath in my throat
Every scar writes lines in my oath
I break the old road
Past the houses that pretended not to know
Every step now says “I’m not owned”
On the walk home

[Final Section]
[crescendo]
Steel in my stride now (hey!)
Thunder in my tired veins
Every echo of their laughter
Melts beneath this rising flame

Gang voices chant my name
Like a war I’ve already won
All their crowns of cardboard
Curl and crumble in the sun

[guitar solo]

Last turn
Front gate
Porch light flares like stadium glow
Doorframe feels
Like an anthem at my back
Family portrait sideways
Crooked halos in a row
They don’t see
How I staggered off attack

[Heroic Key Change]
[Chorus]
