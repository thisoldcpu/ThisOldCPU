Canine and Lepidoptera

Teeth on the tether
Moon stuck to your jaw
You were born for the collar
Still chewing through the law

Concrete under your paw pads
Sky in your wild eyes
Every bark a manifesto
Every growl a war cry

You said
“Chain me to the thunder
I’ll still run”
You said
“Turn your back
Count to none”

Canine and Lepidoptera
Fang and fragile wing collide
One drags the world behind him
One just learns to ride the sky
Canine and Lepidoptera
Muscle
Paper-thin design
You chase the wind in circles
I fall upward every time

You were raised on command words
Sit
Stay
Heel that heart
But I kept folding into colors
Soft escape-art

Pinned me to your question
“Why do you need to fly?”
I left powder on your fingers
When you tried to hold me tight

You said
“Stay where it is safe
Don’t disappear”
I said
“Every cage sounds the same in here”

Heel
Roll over
Play dead for their applause

You tore the leash asunder
Still guarding all their doors

I shed a skin each season
Land lighter when I fall

Together
We’re disaster
That finally learns to crawl

Silence
Then the floor caves in
Your heartbeat stutters
My wings buzz within

“Fetch me the bassline”
You grin
I dive
Gravity glitches
The room comes alive

Can-can-can
Canine
Le-le-le
Lepidoptera

Jaw on the kick drum
Wing on the sub
Fur in the feedback
We laugh as it floods

Circuits convulsing
Strobes in our veins
We chase the drop together
Through digital rain

If I burn out mid-ascent
Catch the shimmer
Not the fall
You were built to break the fences
I was born to dodge the wall

Canine and Lepidoptera
Out of step and still aligned
You guard the gate of everything
I slip right through the lines
