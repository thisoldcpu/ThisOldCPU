Airlock of Shame

[Verse 1]
We met in Dock B-9
Overcaffeinated
Underqualified
"flight crew"
You said
"Ever tried artificial gravity
Set to 'barely'?" and I said
"Obviously
Yes"
[spoken
Tight] I lied
You palmed the override
Flashing panels
Warning banners
You called it "mood lighting"
I called it "OSHA violation with benefits"

Mag boots clicking down the corridor
Your laugh bouncing off titanium ribs
You keyed in that maintenance hatch
"Authorized personnel and terrible ideas only"
We qualified
Instantly

[Pre-Chorus]
[staccato] Helmet off
Heart on
Locker door
Shields gone
Code beeping
Clothes falling
Systems calling-calling-[vocal chops: "warning
Warning
Warning"]
Gravity hiccups
Lips collide
"Probably fine
" you said
You lied

[Chorus]
Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
Two fools on the edge of vacuum
Skin on steel
We’re half divine
Half doomed
Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
If this is how the story ends
We go spinning through the stars as more than friends

[Verse 2]
Phase II: the clumsy dressing montage
One sock on
One glove off
You trying to find your pants
I’m trying to find my dignity behind that CO2 scrubber
"Don’t touch that panel
" you said
Which is exactly when my elbow
Filed for divorce from my brain

[spoken
Building] Sirens
Red strobes
That passive-aggressive AI voice:
"Cycle sequence initiated"
I’m hopping on one leg in slow motion
You’re wrestling a jumpsuit like it owes you money
We lunge for the cancel button
We both miss
Of course we do

[Pre-Chorus]
[rapid modulations] Pressure drops
Time bends
Countdown starts
No friends
Boots slipping
Suit zipping
Lock’s tripping-tripping-[vocal chops: "five… four… three…"]
You shout "Hit abort!"
I hit… my face
We brace

[Chorus]
Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
Two dots on the radar
Gone
Half-dressed comets in the breaking dawn
Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
Spiraling past the cargo bays
Leaving socks and common sense behind in rays

[Bridge]
[low vocal register] Vacuum kiss on the window
Frost blooms where our breath used to hang
You say
"Well
At least the view’s inclusive"
I say
"We just invented naked orbital tango"
We’re tumbling through recycled starlight
Your hair a halo in zero-g
Thrusters fire on some poor passing shuttle
Catching sight of us
Like a Renaissance painting
Sponsored by bad decisions

You take my hand
Fingers in my glove ring
"We could’ve gone to dinner"
"We could’ve stayed on the ship"
We both laugh
Small and terrified
Then louder
Because what else is there

[Chorus]
[crescendo
Key up
Choirs enter] Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
Choirs roar
We refuse to fall
We’re the patron saints of almost putting button labels on the wall
Hooked up in an airlock
Baby
Arena of the endless night
We go screaming into legend
Burning bright

[Chorus]
[final key change
Harmonized guitars
Stacked choirs]
[Chorus]
