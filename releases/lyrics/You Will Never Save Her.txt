Lyrics for You Will Never Save Her by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Intro]
Rain on the neon blinds
Coffee gone cold on my desk
Files stacked like funeral pyres
Her photo on top
Lipstick on a filter-tip
Ashtray full of yesterdays
The city hums
Low and cruel
It knows what I forgot

[Verse 1]
She walked in once
Cheap perfume
Million-dollar eyes
Left a smear of red on my glass
Said
“Some men want me gone.”
Now every alley says her name
In flickering
Faulty signs
Every shadow wears her shoes
Then limps into the fog

[Chorus]
You will never save her
This case was closed before you came
Every clue just cuts you deeper
Every lead just spells her name
You will never save her
Write it in cigarette burns
You can chase that fading figure
But the hallway always turns

[Verse 2]
Down by the riverfront cranes
I found her earring in the mud
A single sparkle in the grime
Like hope playing dress-up
Cops said
“Wrong girl
Wrong night”
Penned her in with other ghosts
But the way the tide pulled back
Felt like something letting go

[Chorus]
You will never save her
This case was closed before you came
Every clue just cuts you deeper
Every lead just spells her name
You will never save her
Write it in cigarette burns
You can chase that fading figure
But the hallway always turns

[Bridge]
[tempo shift]
Desk flips
Sirens melt
The whole world stutters sideways
Walls bend
Basslines sneer
My heartbeat thrown off-time
Her voice chopped into fragments
“save—me—save—me—save—”
Each syllable a swing
From something bigger than a gun

[growled vocal]
I kick the door of heaven
Find only mirrors
Broken wide
Seven shadows in a circle
Each one wearing my face

[Drop]
[instrumental carnage
Screamed ad-libs]
“She’s—already—gone!” (gone, gone)
“Already—gone!”

[Chorus]
[full band slams back in
Cleaner tone
Gang vocals]

[Finale]
Key change like a bad idea
We do it anyway
Fists raised
I stand on the hood of a wreck
Tie flapping like a flag
Tell the skyline
“I was there”
Even if I always lose
Some stories stay unsolved
But I still choose the chase

[Chorus]
