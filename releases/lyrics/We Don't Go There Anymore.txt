We Don't Go There Anymore

[Intro]
Spinning lights
Click track counting
Crowd already shouting
Before we hit a note

[Verse 1]
We used to lace our days
With petty little civil wars
Kept a map of every grievance
Pinned up on the kitchen door

Every small slight
Sharpened like a blade
Every old fight
Numbered
Filed
And saved

[Pre-Chorus]
But all that poison
Tasted the same
I got bored
Of losing the game
So I burned that map
In the sink one night
Watched our favorite grudges
Curl up in white light

[Chorus]
We don’t go there anymore
That dead-end exit off our road
Those haunted houses we once swore
We’d keep living in like ghosts
We don’t dig up every score
Don’t drag old bones across the floor
Whatever lived behind that door
We don’t go there anymore

[Verse 2]
Remember how we’d reenact
That party in ‘09
Pausing every awkward laugh
Freeze-framing every eye roll line

Rewinding
Reliving
Like a courtroom show
You’d cross-examine
I’d forget my notes

[Pre-Chorus]
But every rerun
Faded to gray
Same old dialogue
Different day
So I pulled the plug
On that endless tape
Let the credits roll
On our cold case

[Chorus]
We don’t go there anymore
That dead-end exit off our road
Those haunted houses we once swore
We’d keep living in like ghosts
We don’t dig up every score
Don’t drag old bones across the floor
Whatever lived behind that door
We don’t go there anymore

[Bridge – The Absurd Battle]
[double-time
Screamed vocals]
Left side:
“List your grudges!”
Right side:
“Name your sins!”
Middle:
“Load the past!
Let the trial begin!” (hey!)

Sixteen measure tantrum
Flashing all our teeth
Every “you always”
Every “you never”
Set to blast-beat speed

[growled]
Ancient screenshots
Printed out like flags
Passive-aggressive
Paper rags

[Sudden Drop Setup]
Then—
Hard cut
Air sucked
Silence
One cough from the seats
Click
Low hum
Bass like a beast

[Dubstep Breakdown / Drop]
[half-time
Processed vocals]
You said
“Remember when—”
[glitch]
I said
“Rewind it again—”
[stutter]
The room bends
The walls flex
Our old words
Turn to insects

Drop

[shouted over wobbling bass]
All that drama?
Shaken to dust
Every accusation?
Bent out of trust
We stomp the floor
Till the floor gives way
Let the past fall through
To another day

[Build Back Up]
[spoken
Rising]
Count it in
One for every pointless war
Two for every slammed door
Three for every sleepless night
Four and we step into the light—

[crescendo
Gang shouts]
HEY!

[Final Chorus – Cheesy Arena Finale
Key Change]
[soaring vocals
Key change]
We don’t go there anymore
Leave all that wreckage where it lies
We’ve got a bigger
Burning sky
Than any tape we’d ever rewind
We don’t bleed for every score
Don’t swing at shadows like before
Whatever lived behind that door
We don’t go there anymore

[Outro]
Hands up
Stage glow
We bow
Let it go
Spotlight fades
Crowd still roars
But we
We don’t go there anymore
