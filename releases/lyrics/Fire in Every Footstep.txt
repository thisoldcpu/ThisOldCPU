Lyrics for Fire in Every Footstep by deschutescore (Jason McClain, 2026)

[Intro]
[whispered vocals]
Feet on the floor
Hands to the drum
Name every border
One by one

[Verse 1]
Old road
Red dust on my tongue
Grandfather’s rhythm
In a language I’ve sung
Wires in the ceiling
Cities in my hand
Heartbeat counting
Faster than the band

[Chorus]
Fire in every footstep
Ashes in the air we share
We are the echo and the answer
Shouting from the open square
Fire in every footstep
Circles in the pounding ground
If we keep moving together
They can’t turn the volume down

[Verse 2]
Salt sweat
Colors on my skin
Henna on my fingers
Callus on my shins
One voice breaks
Then a hundred rise
Paint on our faces
Pixels in our eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[low vocal register]
Left side
Right side
Same dust
Same tide
Name your god
I’ll keep time
Raise your fist
I’ll raise mine
[call-and-response chants]
Oh-oh
We don’t fade
Oh-oh
We’re remade

[Chorus]
